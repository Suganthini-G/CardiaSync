# ECG Monitoring System using Flutter

## Overview
This mobile application monitors and visualizes ECG data in real-time. It connects to a Firebase database for data storage and communicates with an IoT device to collect ECG readings. The app also predicts arrhythmia categories using a deep learning model.

## Purpose
Research: Cost-Effective ECG Machine Synchronized to Mobile Phone for Data Display and Analysis

## Features
- Cross-platform mobile app developed with Flutter.
- Integration with Firebase for real-time data storage.
- Communication with an IoT device for ECG data collection.
- Real-time monitoring and visualization of ECG data.
- Data analytics using a deep learning model.

## Requirements
- Flutter SDK
- Firebase account for database setup
- IoT device for ECG data collection
- Android or iOS device for testing the app

## Installation
- Clone the repository: git clone [repository_url]
- Navigate to the project directory: cd [project_directory]
